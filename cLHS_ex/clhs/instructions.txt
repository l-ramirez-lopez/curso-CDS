Conditioned Latin hypercube sampling

Selecting n no. samples from data N, so the n samples form a Latin hypercube.
Note this version only selects from continuous data.

Datafile in text format, no heading
Heading, if non-numerals will be skipped (ignored)
If heading is numerals, it could be treated as data, so be careful!
- If data has a coordinate (x,y) set icord = 1, the file format is in x,y, variable 1, 2, ....
Note: the coordinates will not be used in forming the hypercube, if want to include x,y in the hypercube use the selection below.
- If only contains the variables (set icord=0), the file format is in variable 1, 2, ....

Note: data are read in single precision only!

Modify the "clhs_input.txt" file for the parameter to run the program.

$lhi
infile='data.txt'				! input data file (see above)	
outfile='out_data.txt'				! output file
nvar=3						! number of variables
nsam=200					! number of samples
icord=0						! icord =1 datafile contains coordinates, otherwise icord=0
w1=1.0						! optimisation weight to data
w2=0.5						! optimisation weight to correlations among data varaiables
niter=20000					! number of iterations (usually greater than 20 000 to get a good hypercube)
tfactr=0.99					! anneal cooling schedule (no need to modify)
$end

The output files gives the samples, and also index (position) in the datafile
If coordinates are specified the output will be index (row no.), x, y, variables... otherwise: index (row no.), variables...
A file calle "output.txt" produces the Quantiles, correlations, and occupancy of the hypercube
A file calle "iter.txt" gives the iterations and residuals.

Note the program iterates to minimise the following objective function:
O = w1 * O1 + w2 * O2
w1, and w2 is the weight to the objective function O1 and O2.
O1 = 1/(n*n_var) * Sum_i=1 to n [Sum_j=1 to n_var [ abs(h(i,j)-1) ]]
	where n is no. samples, n_var is no. variables, h is the occupancy of the hypercube
O2 = 1/(nvar*nvar) * Sum_j=1 to n_var [Sum_k=1 to n_var [ abs(ch(j,k)-c(j,k)) ]]
 	where ch is the variables correlation of the sampled points and c is correlation of the original data.
